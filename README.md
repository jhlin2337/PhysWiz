# PhysWiz
I worked on PhysWizOriginal with two other people during the spring of 2016 as a final project for a class we were taking together.
During the start of 2017, I read 'Code Complete' by Steve McConnell and rewrote some of the code for PhysWiz by myself in order
to practice some of the concepts I learned from the book.
